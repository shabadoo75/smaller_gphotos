# Smaller Google Photos
Are you runing out of space in your Google account because of your photos and videos? This script uses ffmpeg to re-transcode your photos and videos so they take up less space.

1. In Google Photos click on "Storage", download your largest photos
2. Run transcode.sh in the photos directory
3. Delete the photos from your Google Photos
4. Upload the smaller photos from the "small" directory
